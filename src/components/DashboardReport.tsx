While your market position allows you to cross revenue targets in the ${revenueTier} bracket, your operational foundation relies almost exclusively on manual execution. The lack of standard automation frameworks means that scaling up will directly increase operational friction, leading to severe profit margin leakage and high staff burnout. Additionally, high owner dependency within ${lowestPillar.name} (currently operating at a critical ${lowestPillar.score}% performance score) creates a severe structural headwind for your organization. Because daily verification, strategic planning, and process execution are heavily anchored to your personal leadership, strategic throughput is directly restricted to the limits of your personal bandwidth rather than a repeatable, self-sustaining system. Decoupling this pillar from your manual daily oversight through standardized frameworks is the single highest-leverage intervention required to plug active margin leaks and capture the ${dynamicHiddenRev} in trapped scaling value.`;
